# Reverse Parking System  

A Reverse Parking System designed to assist drivers in safely parking their vehicles by providing real-time distance measurements and collision warnings. The system uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles behind the vehicle and alerts the driver with visual or audio signals, improving safety and reducing parking-related accidents.  


# Features  
  1. Obstacle Detection: Identifies objects behind the vehicle during reverse parking.
  2. Real-Time Distance Measurement**: Continuously calculates the distance between the vehicle and obstacles.  
  3. Alert Mechanism:  
     3.1 Audio Alerts: Beeping sound that increases in frequency as the vehicle approaches an obstacle.  
     3.2 Visual Alerts: LED indicators or a digital display showing the distance.  
     3.3 Compact and Reliable Design**: Easy to install and maintain.  
  4. User-Friendly: Intuitive and effective feedback system for drivers.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Hardware**:  
  - **Ultrasonic Sensors**: Detect objects and measure distances.  
  - **Microcontroller**: NodeMCU (ESP8266) or Arduino for processing data.  
  - **Buzzer**: Provides audio alerts.  
  - **LEDs/Display**: Indicates the proximity of obstacles.  

- **Software**:  
  - **Programming Languages**: C/C++ (Arduino IDE) for microcontroller programming.  
  - **Real-Time Monitoring**: IoT integration using NodeMCU for advanced applications.

## **How It Works**  
1. **Obstacle Detection**: Ultrasonic sensors emit sound waves, which bounce back upon hitting an object.  
2. **Distance Calculation**: The system calculates the distance based on the time taken for the sound waves to return.  
3. **Alerts**:  
   - When the obstacle is detected within a critical range, a buzzer beeps, and LEDs/display indicate the distance.  
   - Beeping frequency increases as the distance decreases.

## **Installation and Setup**  
1. **Hardware Setup**:  
   - Attach ultrasonic sensors to the rear of the vehicle.  
   - Connect sensors to the microcontroller (NodeMCU or Arduino).  
   - Connect the buzzer and LEDs/display for alert mechanisms.  

2. **Software Configuration**:  
   - Write the microcontroller code using Arduino IDE.  
   - Upload the code to the NodeMCU or Arduino.  
   - Test the system for accuracy by placing objects at different distances.  

3. **Power Supply**:  
   - Use the vehicle's power supply or an independent battery pack for operation.
